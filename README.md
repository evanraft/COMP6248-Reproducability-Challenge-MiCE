# COMP6248 Reproducability Challenge, MiCE

We tried to reproduce the paper "MICE: MIXTURE OF CONTRASTIVE EXPERTS FOR UNSUPERVISED IMAGE CLUSTERING". Using CIFAR-10 dataset we trained and testing two
different approaches, one baseline unsupervised model named moCo, and the Mixture of Contrastive Experts (MiCE).

The official code was used for reproducing the authors results. the train_MiCE file has the code for creating the model, the training and the evaluation on test
data
